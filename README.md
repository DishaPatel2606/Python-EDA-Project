## Overview
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset to uncover insights, patterns, and trends. The analysis focuses on understanding the structure and distribution of the data, detecting outliers, and identifying key relationships between variables.

### Key Steps in the EDA:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing outliers.
2. **Data Transformation**: Applying necessary transformations to variables for better analysis.
3. **Descriptive Statistics**: Generating summary statistics to understand the central tendency, variability, and distribution of the data.
4. **Data Visualization**: Creating visual representations like histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to gain deeper insights.

### Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (mention if you used any other libraries)
- Jupyter Notebook

### Key Insights:
- Perform Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
- Identify correlations between the following attributes of the dataset; BMI & Pregnancies, Insulin & Blood Pressure e.t.c.



### Files in the Repository:
- **EDA(1).ipynb**: Contains the Jupyter Notebook with all the steps involved in the Exploratory Data Analysis.
- **dataset.csv(1)**: The dataset used for analysis.
